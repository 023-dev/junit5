# JUnit Lambda Prototype

The goal of the prototype phase is to come up with some working code that will entice people to give us feedback on the **programming model, APIs, and SPIs** as described in the sections below. At the current stage, we **ARE NOT COLLECTING FEEDBACK ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION** because it's in large parts neither polished, nor thoroughly tested, nor stable.

We are also not accepting any pull requests at this time, for the following reasons:

- **Focus**: The goal of the prototype is to get feedback on the API and programming model. Focusing on code style, formatting, and other details will distract the community's (and our) attention. A lot of the code in the prototype will potentially be rewritten anyway.
- **Legal reasons**: Any contributor will have to sign a contributor's agreement along the lines of [Contributing.md](https://github.com/junit-team/junit-lambda/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). The exact details have not been figured out yet, but we will contact you *before accepting your first pull request*.

If you want to provide input in the interim, please use [the project's issue tracker](https://github.com/junit-team/junit-lambda/issues) or send us comments via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/junitlambda).
