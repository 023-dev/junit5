# JUnit Lambda Prototype

The goal of the prototype phase is to come up with some working code that will entice people to give us feedback on APIs and SPIs. If you want to do that use [the project's issue tracker](https://github.com/junit-team/junit-lambda/issues), add something to [the feedback page](https://github.com/junit-team/junit-lambda/wiki/Prototype-Feedback), or comment on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/junitlambda).

## Installation

We haven't deployed the artifacts to maven yet. That's why the most comfortable way to try JUnit Lambda
is to clone the [git repository](https://github.com/junit-team/junit-lambda), play around in [our sample project](https://github.com/junit-team/junit-lambda/blob/master/sample-project/) or create a sample project of your own with dependencies set as in [/sample-project/build.gradle](https://github.com/junit-team/junit-lambda/blob/master/sample-project/build.gradle).

We plan to provide maven artifacts as soon as the prototype phase is over.
