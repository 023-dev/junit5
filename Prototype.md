# JUnit Lambda Prototype

The goal of the prototype phase is to come up with some working code that will entice people to give us feedback on **APIs and public interfaces** as described in the sections below. At the current stage we **DO NOT COLLECT FEEDBACK ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION** because it's in large parts neither polished, nor thoroughly tested, nor stable.

We're also not accepting any pull requests. This has two reasons:

- The goal of the prototype is to get feedback on the API. Focusing on code style, formatting and other details will distract the community's (and our) attention. Most (if not all) of the code will be rewritten anyway.
- Legal reasons. Any contributor will have to sign a contributor's agreement along the line of  [Contributing.md](https://github.com/junit-team/junit-lambda/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). The exact details have not been figured out yet, but we will contact you *before accepting your first pull request*.

If you want to do that use [the project's issue tracker](https://github.com/junit-team/junit-lambda/issues), or comment on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/junitlambda).

## Installation

We haven't deployed the artifacts to maven yet. That's why the most comfortable way to try JUnit Lambda
is to clone the [git repository](https://github.com/junit-team/junit-lambda), play around in [our sample project](https://github.com/junit-team/junit-lambda/blob/master/sample-project/) or create a sample project of your own with dependencies set as in [/sample-project/build.gradle](https://github.com/junit-team/junit-lambda/blob/master/sample-project/build.gradle).

We plan to provide maven artifacts as soon as the prototype phase is over.
