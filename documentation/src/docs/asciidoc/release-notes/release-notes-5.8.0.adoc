=== JUnit Vintage

==== Bug Fixes

* If multiple exceptions are registered as failures for a JUnit 4 based test -- for
  example, if the `ErrorCollector` rule throws an
  `org.junit.runners.model.MultipleFailureException` -- all of those failures are now
  added as _suppressed exceptions_ in the `org.opentest4j.MultipleFailuresError` created
  by the `VintageTestEngine`. This allows users to analyze the stack trace of each failure
  when such a test fails.
