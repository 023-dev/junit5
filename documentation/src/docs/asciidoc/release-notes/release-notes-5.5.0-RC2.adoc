==== Bug Fixes

* Extensions registered programmatically using `@RegisterExtension` on fields of test
  classes now work correctly for tests in contained `@Nested` test classes. Previously,
  such extensions were registered multiple times for each test method in @Nested` classes.

==== New Features and Improvements

* Parameterized tests now support implicit conversion from a `String` to the following
  `java.time` types for : `Duration`, `Period`, `MonthDay`, `ZoneId`, and `ZoneOffset`.
* A new `getOrDefault()` convenience method has been added to `ExtensionContext.Store`.
* The `JRE` enum now supports Java 14.
