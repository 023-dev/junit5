=== JUnit Platform Test Kit

The `junit-platform-testkit` artifact provides support for executing a test plan on the
JUnit Platform and then verifying the expected results. As of JUnit Platform 1.4, this
support is limited to the execution of a single `TestEngine` (see <<testkit-engine>>).

==== Engine Test Kit

The `{testkit-engine-package}` package provides support for executing a `{TestPlan}` for a
given `{TestEngine}` running on the JUnit Platform and then accessing the results via a
fluent API to verify the expected results. The key entry point into this API is the
`{EngineTestKit}`.
