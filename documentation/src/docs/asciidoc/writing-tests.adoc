=== Annotations

JUnit 5 supports the following annotations for configuring tests and extending the framework.

All core annotations are located in the `{api-package}` package in the `junit5-api`
module.

[cols="20,80"]
|===
| Annotation         | Description

| `@Test`            | Denotes that a method is a test method. Unlike JUnit 4's `@Test` annotation, this annotation does not declare any attributes, since test extensions in JUnit 5 operate based on their own dedicated annotations.
| `@DisplayName`     | Declares a custom display name for the test class or test method
| `@BeforeEach`      | Denotes that the annotated method should be executed _before_ *each* `@Test` method in the current class or class hierarchy
| `@AfterEach`       | Denotes that the annotated method should be executed _after_ *each* `@Test` method in the current class or class hierarchy
| `@BeforeAll`       | Denotes that the annotated method should be executed _before_ *all* `@Test` methods in the current class or class hierarchy; analogous to JUnit 4's `@BeforeClass`. Such methods must be `static`.
| `@AfterAll`        | Denotes that the annotated method should be executed _after_ *all* `@Test` methods in the current class or class hierarchy; analogous to JUnit 4's `@AfterClass`. Such methods must be `static`.
| `@Nested`          | Denotes that the annotated class is a nested, non-static test class. Due to restrictions of the Java language, `@BeforeAll` and `@AfterAll` methods cannot be used in a `@Nested` test class.
| `@Tag` and `@Tags` | Used to declare _tags_ for filtering tests, either at the class or method level; analogous to test groups in TestNG or Categories in JUnit 4
| `@Disabled`        | Used to _disable_ a test class or test method; analogous to JUnit 4's `@Ignore`
| `@ExtendWith`      | Used to register custom <<extension-model, extensions>> to the framework.

[[meta-annotations]]
==== Meta-Annotations and Composed Annotations

JUnit 5 annotations can be used as _meta-annotations_. That means that you can define
your own _composed annotation_ that will automatically _inherit_ the semantics of its
meta-annotations.

For example, instead of copying and pasting `@Tag("fast")` throughout your code base (see
<<tagging-and-filtering>>), you can create a custom _composed annotation_ named `@Fast`
as follows. `@Fast` can then be used as a drop-in replacement for `@Tag("fast")`.

Notice that neither the test class nor the test method need to be `public`.


=== Custom Names

Test classes and test methods can declare a custom name -- with spaces, special
characters, and even emojis -- that will be displayed by test runners and test reporting:

=== Assertions

JUnit 5 comes with many of the assertion methods that JUnit 4 has and adds a few that
lend themselves well to being used with Java 8 lambdas. All JUnit 5 assertions are static
methods in the `{Assertions}` class.

=== Assumptions

JUnit 5 comes with a subset of the assumption methods that JUnit 4 provides and adds a
few that lend themselves well to being used with Java 8 lambdas. All JUnit 5 assumptions
are static methods in the `{Assumptions}` class.

[[tagging-and-filtering]]
=== Tagging and Filtering

Test classes and methods can be tagged. Those tags can later be used to filter
<<running-tests,test discovery and execution>>:

=== Nested Tests

Nested tests give the test writer more capabilities to express the relationship among
several group of tests. Here's an elaborate example:

----
include::{testDir}/example/TestingAStack.java[tags=user_guide]
----

Notice that _only non-static inner classes_ can serve as nested tests. Nesting can be
arbitrarily deep, and those inner classes can be considered as full members of the test
class family with one exception: `@BeforeAll` and `@AfterAll` do not work, because Java
does not allow static members in non-static inner classes.

=== Method Parameters and Dependency Injection

In all prior JUnit versions, methods were not allowed to have parameters (at least not
with the standard `Runner` implementations). As one of the major changes in JUnit 5,
methods are now permitted to have parameters. This allows for greater flexibility and
enables method-level _Dependency Injection_.

`{MethodParameterResolver}` defines the API for test extensions that wish to
_dynamically_ resolve method parameters at runtime. If a `@Test`, `@BeforeEach`,
`@AfterEach`, `@BeforeAll`, or `@AfterAll` method accepts a parameter, the parameter must
be resolved at runtime by a registered `MethodParameterResolver`.

There are currently two built-in resolvers that are registered automatically.

* `{TestInfoParameterResolver}`: if a method parameter is of type `{TestInfo}`, the
  `TestInfoParameterResolver` will supply an instance of `TestInfo` corresponding to the
  current test as the value for the parameter. The `TestInfo` can then be used to retrieve
  information about the current test such as the test's name or display name (as
  configured via `@DisplayName`). This acts as a drop-in replacement for the `TestName`
  rule from JUnit 4. See `TestInfoDemo` for an example.

[subs="verbatim"]
----
include::{testDir}/example/TestInfoDemo.java[tags=user_guide]
----

* `{TestReporterParameterResolver}`: if a method parameter is of type `{TestReporter}`, the
  `TestReporterParameterResolver` will supply an instance of `TestReporter`.
  The `TestReporter` can be used to publish additional data about the current test run.
  The data can be consumed through `{TestExecutionListener}.reportingEntryPublished()` and thus
  be viewed by IDEs or included in reports.
+
In JUnit 5 you should use `TestReporter` where
you used to print information to `stdout` or `stderr` in JUnit 4.
Using `@RunWith(JUnit5.class)` will even output all reported entries to `stdout`.

Other parameter resolvers must be explicitly enabled by registering a <<extension-model,
test extension>> via `@ExtendWith`.

* Check out the `{MockitoExtension}` for an example of a `{MethodParameterResolver}`. While not
  intended to be production-ready, it demonstrates the simplicity and expressiveness of
  both the extension model and the parameter resolution process. `MyMockitoTest`
  demonstrates how to inject Mockito mocks into `@BeforeEach` and `@Test` methods.

		assertEquals("Dilbert", person.getName());
