==== JUnit Platform

===== Bug Fixes

===== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* The `@API` annotation has been removed from the `junit-platform-commons` project and
  relocated to a new standalone project on GitHub called the _@API Guardian_.
* Tags are no longer permitted to contain any of the following _reserved characters_.
  - `,`, `(`, `)`, `&`, `|`, `!`
* The constructor for `FilePosition` has been replaced with a static factory method named
  `from(int, int)`.
* A `FilePosition` can now be constructed solely from a line number via the new
  `from(int)` static factory method.
* `FilePosition.getColumn()` now returns `Optional<Integer>` instead of `int`.
* The constructors in the following concrete `TestSource` implementations have been
  replaced with static factory methods named `from(...)`.
  - `ClasspathResourceSource`
  - `ClassSource`
  - `CompositeTestSource`
  - `DirectorySource`
  - `FileSource`
  - `MethodSource`
  - `PackageSource`
